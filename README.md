### Jason D. Moss

## I handcraft websites.

Or, to be more specific, I plan, develop, implement and maintain modern sites: from large multi-tiered sites, small single-page applications, custom APIs, to custom modules and plug-ins.

I specialize in developing with Drupal, Laravel, Craft CMS, WordPress and countless other tools and solutions (Symfony, ExpressionEngine, b2evolution, Shopify, to name just a few).

***Compliant. Portable. Functional.***
